In this file, Iâ€™ll discuss a project where I worked on predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms.
The algorithms included K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. 
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle.
